However, this paragraph shall in no way be construed as providing any form of guarantee or assurance that the Platform will eventually be completed or be fully operational. 
1.5	Potential Risks
By purchasing, holding and using the Tokens, you expressly acknowledge and assume the risks set out in this section. If any of these risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, the business, financial, condition, results of operations and prospects of the Company or its Affiliates may be materially and adversely affected. In such cases, you may lose all or part of the value of the Token. Such risks include but are not limited to the following:

Risks Relating to the Tokens
(a)	The Tokens are intended to be native tokens to be used on the Platform, and the Company and its Affiliates have not and may not actively facilitate any secondary trading or external trading of Tokens. In the event that the Tokens are traded on a cryptocurrency exchange, there is no assurance that an active or liquid trading market for the Tokens will develop or if developed, be sustained. There is also no assurance that the market price of the Tokens will not decline below the purchase amount paid for the Tokens, which is not indicative of such market price.
(b)	A Token is not a currency issued by any central bank or national, supra-national or quasi-national organization, nor is it backed by any hard assets or other credit. The Company and its Affiliates are not responsible for nor do they pursue the circulation and trading of the Tokens on the market. Trading of the Tokens merely depends on the consensus on its value between the relevant market participants, and no one is obliged to acquire any Token from any holder of the Token, including the purchasers of the Tokens, nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price of the Tokens to any extent at any time. Accordingly, the Company and its Affiliates cannot ensure that there will be any demand or market for the Tokens, or that the price upon which the Tokens were purchased is indicative of the market price of the Tokens if they are made available for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange.  

Risks Relating to the Company, its Affiliates and the Platform
(a)	Limited availability of sufficient information. The Platform is still at an early development phase as of the date of this Whitepaper. Its governance structure, purpose, consensus mechanism, algorithm, code, infrastructure design and other technical specifications and parameters may be updated and changed frequently without notice. While this Whitepaper contains the key information currently available in relation to the Platform, it is subject to adjustments and updates from time to time, as announced on the Company’s website. Purchasers will not have full access to all the information relevant to the Tokens and/or the Platform. Nevertheless, it is anticipated that significant milestones and progress reports will be announced on the Company’s website.
(b)	The digital assets raised in the sale of the Tokens are exposed to risks of theft. Whilst the Company and its Affiliates will make every effort to ensure that the ETH received from the sale of Tokens are securely held through the implementation of security measures, there is no assurance that there will be no theft of the cryptocurrencies as a result of hacks, mining attacks, sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects on such blockchain addresses, the Ethereum Blockchain, or any other blockchain, or otherwise. Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof. In such event, even if the sale of Tokens is completed, the Company and its Affiliates may not be able to receive the cryptocurrencies raised and the Company and its Affiliates may not be able to utilize such funds for the development of the Platform, and the launch of the Platform might temporarily or permanently curtailed. As such, the issued Tokens may hold little worth or value. The Tokens are uninsured, unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. In the event of any loss or loss of value of the Tokens, you may have no recourse. 
(c)	The blockchain address(es) may be compromised and the digital assets may not be able to be retrieved. The blockchain address(es) are designed to be secured. However, in the event that the blockchain address(es) for the receipt of purchase amounts or otherwise are, for any reason, compromised (including but not limited to scenarios of the loss of keys to such blockchain address(es), the funds held at such blockchain address(es) may not be able to be retrieved and disbursed, and may be permanently unrecoverable. In such event, even if the sale of the Tokens is successful, the Company and its Affiliates will not be able to receive the funds raised and the Company and its Affiliates will not be able to utilise such funds for the development of the Platform, and the implementation of the Platform might be temporarily or permanently curtailed. As such, distributed Tokens may hold little worth or value.
(d)	There is no assurance of any success of the Platform and the Company and its Affiliates may cease the development, launch and operation of the Platform The value of, and demand for, the Tokens hinges heavily on the performance of the Platform. There is no assurance that the Platform will gain traction after its launch and achieve any commercial success. The Platform has not been fully developed, finalised and integrated and is subject to further changes, updates and adjustments prior to its launch. Such changes may result in unexpected and unforeseen effects on its projected appeal to users, and hence impact its success. There are no guarantees that the process for creating the Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free. 
While the Company has made every effort to provide a realistic estimate, there is also no assurance that the cryptocurrencies raised in the sale of Tokens will be sufficient for the development and integration of the Platform. For the foregoing or any other reason, the development and integration of the Platform may not be completed and there is no assurance that its systems, protocols or products will be launched at all. As such, distributed Tokens may hold little or no worth or value. Additional reasons which may result in the termination of the development, launch or operation of the Platform includes, but is not limited to, (aa) an unfavourable fluctuation in the value of cryptographic and fiat currencies, (bb) the inability of the Company and its Affiliates to establish the Platform or the Tokens’ utility or to resolve technical problems and issues faced in relation to the development or operation of the Platform or the Token, the failure of commercial relationships, (cc) intellectual property disputes during development or operation, and (dd) changes in the future capital needs of the Company or its Affiliates and the availability of financing and capital to fund such needs. For the aforesaid and other reasons, the Platform may no longer be a viable project and may be dissolved or simply not launched, negatively impacting the Platform and the potential utility and value of the Tokens.
(e)	There may be lack of demand for the Platform and the services provided, which would impact the value of the Tokens. There is a risk that upon launching of the Platform, there is a lack of interest from consumers, merchants, advertisers, and other key participants for the Platform and the services, and that there may be limited interest and therefore use of the Platform and the Tokens. Such a lack of interest could impact the operation of the Platform and the uses or potential value of the Tokens.
There is a risk of competition from alternative platforms that may have been established, or even from existing businesses which would target any segment of the potential users of the Platform fulfilling similar demands, e.g. corporations targeting advertisers seeking purchase consumer data and market analysis. Therefore, in the event that the competition results in a lack of interest and demand for the Platform, the services and the Tokens, the operation of the Platform and the value of the Tokens may be negatively impacted.
(f)	The Company and its Affiliates may experience system failures, unplanned interruptions in its network or services, hardware or software defects, security breaches or other causes that could adversely affect the Company or its Affiliates’ infrastructure network, or the Platform.
(i)	The Company and its Affiliates are unable to anticipate or detect when there would be occurrences of hacks, cyber-attacks, mining attacks (including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks), distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects in the Platform, the Tokens, or any technology (including but not limited to smart contract technology) on which the Company, its Affiliates, the Platform, the Tokens, rely on or the Ethereum Blockchain or any other blockchain. Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof. The Company and its Affiliates may not be able to detect such issues in a timely manner, and may not have sufficient resources to efficiently cope with multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession.
(ii)	Although the Company and its Affiliates will be taking steps against malicious attacks on its appliances or its infrastructure, which are critical for the maintenance of the Platform and its other services, there can be no assurance that cyber-attacks, such as distributed denials of service, will not be attempted in the future, and that any of such security measures will be effective. Any significant breach of security measures or other disruptions resulting in a compromise of the usability, stability and security of the Company and its Affiliates’ network or services, including the Platform.

Risks Relating to the Participation in the Sale of Tokens
(a)	You may not be able to recover the purchase amount paid for the Tokens. Except as provided under any applicable terms of sale or prescribed by applicable laws and regulations, the Company is not obliged to provide you with a refund of the purchase amount. No promises of future performance or price are or will be made in respect to the Tokens, including promises of inherent value or continuing payments, and there is no guarantee that the Tokens will hold any particular value. Therefore, the recovery of the purchase amount may be impossible or may be subject to applicable laws and regulations. You may be subject to adverse legal and/or tax implications as a result of the purchase, distribution and use of the Tokens.
(i)	The legal character of cryptocurrency and cryptographic assets remain uncertain. There is a risk that the Tokens may be considered securities in certain jurisdictions, or may be considered to be securities in certain jurisdictions in the future. The Company and its Affiliates does not provide any warranty or guarantee as to how the Tokens will be classified, and each purchaser will bear all consequences of the Tokens being considered securities in their respective jurisdictions, and bear the responsibility of the legality, use and transfer of the Tokens in the relevant jurisdictions.
(ii)	Further, the tax treatment of the acquisition or disposal of such cryptocurrency or cryptographic assets might depend on whether they are classified as securities, assets, currency or otherwise. As the tax characterization of the Tokens remains indeterminate, you must seek your own tax advice in connection with the purchase, acquisition or disposal of the Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences or tax reporting requirements for you.
(b)	The loss or compromise of information relating to the purchaser wallet and your Platform ID may affect your access to and possession of the Tokens
(c)	There is a risk that you may lose access to and possession of the Tokens permanently due to loss of unique personal ID created on the Platform, and other identification information, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with the purchaser wallet or vault storing the Tokens or any other kind of custodial or purchaser errors.
(d)	Blockchains may face congestion and transactions may be delayed or lost. Most blockchains used for cryptocurrency transactions (e.g. Ethereum) are prone to periodic congestion during which transactions can be delayed or lost. Individuals may also Most blockchains used for cryptocurrency transactions (e.g. Ethereum) are prone to periodic congestion during which transactions can be delayed or lost. Individuals may also intentionally spam the network in an attempt to gain an advantage in purchasing cryptographic tokens. This may result in a situation where block producers may not include your purchase of the Tokens when you intend to transact, or your transaction may not be included at all.
Privacy and data retention issues
As part of the Token sales, the verification processes and the subsequent operation of the Platform, the Company may collect personal information from you. The collection of such information is subject to applicable laws and regulations. All information collected will be used for purposes of the Token sales and operations of the Platform, thus it may be transferred to contractors, service providers and consultants worldwide as appointed by the Company. Apart from external compromises, the Company and its appointed entities may also suffer from internal security breaches whereby their employees may misappropriate, misplace or lose personal information of purchasers. The Company may be required to expend significant financial resources to alleviate problems caused by any breaches or losses, settle fines and resolve inquiries from regulatory or government authorities. Any information breaches or losses will also damage the Company’s reputations, thereby harming its long-term prospects.

Macro Risks
(a)	General global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on the Company and its Affiliates’ operations and the use of the Platform. The Company and its Affiliates could be affected by general global economic and market conditions. Challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time, contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the information technology industry at large. Weakness in the economy may have a negative effect on the Company and its Affiliates’ business strategies, results of operations and prospects. Suppliers on which the Platform relies for servers, bandwidth, location and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that, in turn, could have a negative impact on the Company and its Affiliates’ operations or expenses. 
(b)	There can be no assurance, therefore, that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on the Company and its Affiliates’ business strategies, results of operations and prospects and hence the Platform, which may in turn impact the value of the Tokens.
(c)	The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, Tokens, offering of Tokens, and the Platform remain uncertain, and any changes, regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Platform and the utility of the Tokens.
(i)	Regulation of the Tokens, the offer and sale of Tokens, cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, and cryptocurrency exchanges is currently undeveloped or underdeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve. Such regulation also varies significantly among different jurisdictions, and is hence subject to significant uncertainty. The various legislative and executive bodies in different jurisdictions may in the future adopt laws, regulations, guidance, or other actions, which may severely impact the development and growth of the Platform, the adoption and utility of the Tokens or the issue, offer, and sale of the Tokens by the Company. Failure by the Company and its Affiliates or users of the Platform to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences against the Company and its Affiliates, including civil penalties and fines.
(ii)	Blockchain networks also face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many foreign jurisdictions. Various jurisdictions may, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the Platform, and therefore, the value of the Tokens. Such laws, regulations or directives may directly and negatively impact the operations of the Company and its Affiliates. The effect of any future regulatory change is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and could materially adverse to the development and growth of the Platform and the adoption and utility of the Tokens.
(iii)	To the extent that the Company and its Affiliates may be required to obtain licences, permits and/or approvals (collectively, the “Regulatory Approvals”) to carry out its business, including that of the creation of the Tokens and the development and operation of the Platform, but are unable to obtain such Regulatory Approvals or if such Regulatory Approvals are not renewed or revoked for whatever reason by the relevant authorities, the business of the Company and its Affiliates may be adversely affected.
(iv)	There is no assurance that more stringent requirements will not be imposed upon the Company and its Affiliates by the relevant authorities in the future, or that the Company and its Affiliates will be able to adapt in a timely manner to changing regulatory requirements. These additional or more stringent regulations may restrict the Company and its Affiliates’ ability to operate its business and the Company and its Affiliates may face actions for non-compliance if it fails to comply with any of such requirements.
(v)	Further, should the costs (financial or otherwise) of complying with such newly implemented regulations exceed a certain threshold, maintaining the Platform may no longer be commercially viable and the Company and its Affiliates may opt to discontinue the Platform and/or the Tokens. Further, it is difficult to predict how or whether governments or regulatory authorities may implement any changes to laws and regulations affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Platform and the Tokens. The Company and its Affiliates may also have to cease operations in a jurisdiction that makes it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or make it commercially unviable or undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction. In scenarios such as the foregoing, the distributed Tokens may hold little or no worth or value.
(d)	There may be risks relating to acts of God, natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks, riots, civil commotions widespread communicable diseases and other events beyond the control of the Company and its Affiliates. The sale of the Tokens and the performance of the Company, its Affiliates and/or the Platform’s activities may be interrupted, suspended or delayed due to acts of God, natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks, riots, civil commotions, widespread communicable diseases and other events beyond the control of the Company and its Affiliates. Such events could also lead to uncertainty in the economic outlook of global markets and there is no assurance that such markets will not be affected, or that recovery from the global financial crisis would continue. In such events, the Company and its Affiliates’ business strategies, results of operations and outlook may be materially and adversely affected, and the demand for and use of the Tokens and the Platform may be materially affected. Further, if an outbreak of such infectious or communicable diseases occurs in any of the countries in which the Company, its Affiliates, and the participants of the Platform have operations in the future, market sentiment could be adversely affected and this may have a negative impact on the Platform and its community.
(e)	Blockchain and cryptocurrencies, including the Tokens are a relatively new and dynamic technology. In addition to the risks highlighted herein, there are other risks associated with your purchase of, holding and use of the Tokens, including those that we cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed herein.

1.6 No Further Information or Update 
No person has been or is authorised to give any information or representation not contained in this Whitepaper in connection with the Tokens, the Platform, the Company or its Affiliates and their respective businesses and operations, and, if given, such information or representation must not be relied upon as having been authorised by or on behalf of the Company or its Affiliates. 
1.7 Language
This Whitepaper may be translated into other languages. If any disagreement should arise due to different language translations, the version in English will prevail.
1.8 No Advice 
No information in this Whitepaper should be considered to be business, legal, financial or tax advice regarding the Token, the Platform, the Company or its Affiliates. You should consult your own legal, financial, tax or other professional advisor(s) regarding the Token, the Company or its Affiliates and their respective businesses and operations. You should be aware that you may be required to bear the financial risk of any purchase of the Tokens for an indefinite period of time.
