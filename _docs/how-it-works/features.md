### LAMP Quality
There are four LAMP qualities. As such, even LAMPs of the same quality may have vastly different Attribute distributions.

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">

| Quality      | Min. Attribute   | Max. Attribute   | Level Up      |
|:-------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|:--------------|
| Loyal        | 1                | 10               | 4             |
| Super        | 8                | 35               | 6             |
| Epic         | 28           `   | 63               | 10            |
| Legendary    | 50               | 100              | 12            |


### LAMP Level

Each level-up requires a fixed time to complete, which increases along with the amount of LAMP required according to the LAMP level. Upon level-up, fans will attain 4-12 additional Attribute points to assign according to their LAMP quality.
