**Members-Only Perks**

Each tier of LAMP NFT comes with different voting power for all of the content we create in the Club as well as different level of acknowledgment in drama, the first of which is cast and crew credits. Future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation.

1. **VIP Pass**: You get access to member-only benefits such as *meet the stars*, attend the premiere, and special getaway with the cast and crew members.  

2. **Voting Portal**: LAMP comes with 1 vote on every creative proposal over the direction of Writer's Room contents. You can vote on all creative proposals for the drama ranging from title and genre to plot twists and ending.

3. **Writer's Room**: LAMP pairs Writer's Room members with big-name creatives. You get exclusive admission to Writing's Room to *create-your-own-character* in drama. Your name will be featured in the acknowledgments of the drama written by the Writer's Room. 

4. **Profit Sharing**: You get special chance to license approved contents in exchange for a licensing fee. We will be publishing a free use licensing agreement that any LAMP holders can use to make partnerships with the dramas. When it comes time to make disbursements, we will make them in accordance to the terms you and your partner input into the signed agreement.
