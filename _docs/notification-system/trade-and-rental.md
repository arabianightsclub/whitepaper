This starts with creating an Exchange Account, converting fiat to Cryptocurrency and navigating WEb3 with a Decentralized Wallet. We aim to breach this barrier by introducing a Rental System.

By offering a smart rent/lease system, getting started is as easy as visiting our website and renting a LAMP NFT.
