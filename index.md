**Arabian Nights Club is the world's first Web3 DAO Community Platform Protocol serving as a decentralized drama studio and community treasury equipped themselves with NFTs in the form of LAMP.** A community treasury that includes both fans and creators ensures two key features: One, gatekeeping power is decentralized to an undeniably diverse group with a passion for the content being made, and Two, it engages audience members in ways that would turn social media stars green with envy, as these fans-turned-investors are now activated as that assetâ€™s greatest form of marketing and distribution. 

**LAMP NFT** represents a shift in the ownership of IP from the centralized studio to a community where creators, the fans, the crew, and the investors control the contents and not just the few at the top of industry. Our aim is to connect the public to Web 3.0 and share on the upside of the residuals of drama on a long-term basis, while simultaneously untangling opaque financial accounts through LAMP in the quest for greater transparency.
